# Overview

This project is my first attempt at a 3D game, and I'm having quite a bit of fun with it!

I wrote a small game- more of a demo, really- named "Dreamwalk". It's a top-down, exploration-focused game- or at least it will be once there's more to explore- in which the player, in the role of "The Dreamwalker", rescues NPCs from the nightmarish side of the map and reunites them with their dreams on the peaceful side of the map. Right now, there is only one NPC and one dream in the form of Peggy the Pirate and his pet fox Darthalamus III (He's nobility, by the way), and Peggy isn't fully rescuable yet, but I hope to fix that and also add more in the future.

I like games- especially pretty games- and would eventually like to make one, so I thought this was a good thing to start practicing. I chose Unreal Engine for it both because of my previous C++ experience (even though I decided to learn how to use blueprints instead) and because it's the engine most known for making really pretty games.

# Development Environment

I used Unreal Engine and Visual Studio.

I used a bit of C++, but I really wanted to learn how to use Unreal Engine Blueprints, so most of my functionality is based in those.

# Useful Websites

- [The Unreal Engine Website itself](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.3/en-US/)
- [Youtube, Especially this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=td0rVkL1LVE&t=468s)

# Future Work

- I want to add more things to find and interact with in the game, and figure out how to make more complex blueprints.
- I want to make the game save and load, and I'd like to give it an actual end state (both in the form of death and success)
- I want to create more than one level, probably with more detail.
